# Project Name: Learning Management System (LMS)

## Description
This project involves the maintenance and enhancement of an existing Java-based Learning Management System (LMS). The system is designed to support educational institutions by providing a digital platform where instructors can manage courses, create and grade assignments and quizzes, and communicate with students. Students, on the other hand, can access course materials, submit assignments, and receive feedback.

The primary goal of this phase is to fix existing issues in the codebase and implement enhancements to improve usability, maintainability, and performance.

## Users
- **Admins**: Manage users and oversee platform configuration.
- **Instructors**: Create and manage courses, quizzes, and assignments.
- **Students**: Enroll in courses, submit assignments, and take quizzes.

## Main Features
- Quiz creation, submission, and automatic/manual grading
- Assignment submission and instructor feedback
- Course and lesson management
- Notification system for important updates
- Role-based access control (Admins, Instructors, Students)

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Architecture**: RESTful API
- **Database**: [Specify if known, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL]
- **Tools**: Maven, SonarQube (for code analysis), Git (for version control)

## Purpose of This Phase
- Apply static code analysis to identify maintainability and code quality issues
- Implement individual bug fixes or enhancements based on analysis
- Collaborate using Git and pull requests
- Track progress via an online ticketing system
